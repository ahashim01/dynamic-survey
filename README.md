## 1. Project Overview

The **Advanced Dynamic Survey Platform** is a highly flexible and scalable backend system built using Django and Django REST Framework. It allows enterprise-level customers to design, deploy, and analyze custom surveys with complex logic, field dependencies, and real-time analytics. The system is designed to handle high traffic volumes and ensure data integrity and security.

## 2. Features

- **Dynamic Survey Builder:** Create surveys with multiple sections, various field types, and advanced conditional logic.
- **Survey Submission:** Support for real-time validation, partial submissions, and anonymous responses.
- **Scalability:** Optimized for high traffic with query optimizations and ready for horizontal scaling.
- **Security:** Role-based access control, validation of inputs, and secure handling of sensitive data.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Unit, integration, and validation tests to ensure system reliability and correctness.

## 3. Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Django 4.x, Django REST Framework 3.x
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (recommended, but can work with any Django-supported database)
- **Authentication:** Django’s built-in authentication system
- **Testing:** Django Test Framework, REST Framework’s test utilities, Coverage.py
- **Profiling:** Django Debug Toolbar

## 4. Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advanced-dynamic-survey-platform.git
   cd advanced-dynamic-survey-platform
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3.12 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Setup the database:**
   - Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and running.
   - Create a database and update the `DATABASES` setting in your `settings.py` file or `.env` file.
   - Run migrations:
     ```bash
     python manage.py migrate
     ```

5. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## 5. Environment Variables

This project uses a `.env` file to manage environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the project’s root directory and add the following variables:

```bash
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname
```

Refer to `.env-example` for a template.

## 6. Usage

### API Endpoints

- **Surveys:**
  - `GET /surveys/`: List all surveys.
  - `POST /surveys/`: Create a new survey.
  - `GET /surveys/<id>/`: Retrieve a specific survey.
  - `PUT /surveys/<id>/`: Update a specific survey.
  - `PATCH /surveys/<id>/`: Partially update a specific survey.
  - `DELETE /surveys/<id>/`: Delete a specific survey.

- **Responses:**
  - `GET /responses/`: List all responses.
  - `POST /responses/`: Create a new response.
  - `GET /responses/<id>/`: Retrieve a specific response.
  - `PUT /responses/<id>/`: Update a specific response.
  - `DELETE /responses/<id>/`: Delete a specific response.

### Examples

- **Creating a Survey:**
  ```json
  POST /surveys/
  {
    "title": "Customer Satisfaction Survey",
    "description": "A survey to gauge customer satisfaction.",
    "sections": [
      {
        "title": "General Feedback",
        "order": 1,
        "fields": [
          {
            "label": "How satisfied are you with our service?",
            "field_type": "radio",
            "required": true,
            "order": 1
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

- **Submitting a Response:**
  ```json
  POST /responses/
  {
    "survey": 1,
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "completed": true,
    "response_data": [
      {
        "field": 1,
        "value": "Very Satisfied"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

## 7. Testing

Run the full test suite to ensure everything is working correctly:

```bash
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test
coverage report
coverage html  # Generates an HTML report
```

The test suite covers models, serializers, and views, with specific tests for conditional logic and dependencies.

## 8. Scalability and Performance Considerations

- **Query Optimization:** `select_related` and `prefetch_related` are used to minimize database hits and improve performance.
- **Horizontal Scaling:** The system is designed to be horizontally scalable by using Django’s ability to work with load balancers and distributed databases.
- **Future Improvements:** Consider adding caching (e.g., Redis) and asynchronous task handling (e.g., Celery) for handling background jobs like report generation or batch data processing.

## 9. Security Measures

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implemented with Django’s permissions system.
- **Data Validation:** All inputs are validated through serializers to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other common vulnerabilities.
- **Sensitive Data Handling:** Consideration for field-level encryption and secure handling of sensitive information.

## 10. Future Enhancements

- **API Versioning:** Implement API versioning to ensure backward compatibility as new features are added.
- **Advanced Reporting:** Integrate real-time analytics and reporting features.
- **Improved UI/UX:** Extend the project by adding a frontend (e.g., React, Vue.js) to make the survey creation and submission process more user-friendly.
- **Dockerization:** Set up Docker for containerized deployment and easier environment management.
- **Redis & Celery Integration:** Add Redis and Celery to handle background tasks, such as sending survey invitations or processing large datasets.
